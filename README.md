CRUD APPLICATION

The CRUD application I developed using Java is designed to help users manage data efficiently through Create, Read, Update, and Delete functions. This tool can be adapted for various purposes, such as managing inventory or user profiles, making it a versatile solution for data management.

To ensure a user-friendly experience, I created a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Java's Swing framework. The layout allows users to navigate easily, performing tasks like adding new records, viewing existing data, editing information, and deleting entries with just a few clicks.

In the background, the application connects to a relational database using Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). This setup allows for efficient data storage and retrieval through SQL queries. Each CRUD operation is implemented to handle data accurately while maintaining security.

Throughout this project, I gained valuable experience in Java programming and database management. The CRUD application not only demonstrates my ability to build functional software solutions but also prepares me for future challenges in software development.
